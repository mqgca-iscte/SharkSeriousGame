# Shark Serious Game
A serious game to increase children’s knowledge about the vital role of sharks in marine ecosystems

## Abstract 
Given the alarming decline in shark populations due to overfishing and unsustainable practices, it has become essential to raise public awareness about this environmental crisis. In this context, an educational game was developed, consisting of two mini-games, with the main goal of changing the negative perceptions children may have about sharks.

The game aims to educate young players about the vital role sharks play in maintaining the health of marine ecosystems, using interactive activities to help children understand the challenges these species face due to human actions. The mini-games were designed to be both educational and fun, incorporating adaptive mechanisms that adjust the experience to the different characteristics of the players. This approach allowed for an analysis of how different player profiles interacted with the game, evaluating whether the collected data showed consistent patterns or significant differences between profiles. The dissertation contributes to the field of educational games focused on conservation, promoting a positive change in children's attitudes towards sharks.

Tests conducted with 38 children, aged between 9 and 11, showed a significant increase in their knowledge about sharks and a positive change in perception. Additionally, it was observed that the game adapted well to the different player profiles, allowing all participants, regardless of age, gender, or skills, to intuitively complete the tasks. The study highlights the role of educational games in fostering more responsible and sustainable behaviors in ocean conservation.

## Requirements to play: 
- DualShock 2 connected to the PC. I suggest the installation of the SCPToolkit in order to make the connection since only the use of the USB is not enough.
